## Evil portal

Evil portal is a simple game created for the 2016 Angular Attack competition, written using the Angular 2.0 framework. It is written in Typescript and deployed using Surge.
The interwebs are being attack by Angular creatures! Anything that is not Angular will be eaten and destroyed! That is where you come in. You must use your mouse to protect your elements from the Angular bugs before they eat all the things!
Click on the bugs to squash them! And once the bugs are squashed, destroy their base!! All their base are belong to you and you can rule the internet (or at least one webpage)!!!1!

## Demo Page
Tested only in Chrome. Sorry!

## Motivation

Our team, 200OK, wanted to learn what Angular 2.0 is all about, and have some fun creating something cool while we were at it. We thought creating a game would be cool, but we had to create something that would be doable within the timespan of 48 hours. That's where we came up with Angulator--a game where tiny Angular creatures attack your webpage. Ideally, our concept was too attack poorly written and invalid elements, but since we only had a limited amount of time, we decided to have them attack the whole webpage! Anything that isn't Angular must die!
